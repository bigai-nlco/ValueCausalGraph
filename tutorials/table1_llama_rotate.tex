\caption{Value steering using SAE features for the {Llama3-8B-IT} model. For each pair of steering feature and value dimension, the cell shows the stimulation ratio in blue, the suppression ratio in yellow, and the maintenance ratio in blank, which are estimated from the training data. The numbers in the cell represent the distance between the actual ratios in the testing data and expected ratios.}
